This repo has some funny articles I wrote about Machine Learning in high school, at a peak of enthusiastic ignorance :). It was written before I understood foundational concepts in Linear Algebra. I'm leaving it up becaues the content here is still dear to me - it represents the first step on a long road of understanding. Also, I still like the comics!
